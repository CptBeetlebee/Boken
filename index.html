# The History of Boken-ka
Boken-ka is a tidal-locked moon with a history spanning several thousands of years. Much of it is shrouded in mystery with legends, lies, and myths that are mixed in with actual historical records. The following timeline dates events which have been known to happen. It is sorted as close to chronological order as possible.

## Timeline of Boken-ka
### First Empire (A long time ago)

**The First Empire**, A powerful and technologically advanced civilization, possessing automated factories, satalites, engineering, giant robots, and the ability to travel through space. It is unkown of the origin of this empire or how long they existed. It is not clear if they were from Boken-ka or not; regardless, they were advanced to godlike levels of science, magic, and power.

**The War of Behemoths**; At some point a war broke out between the First Empire and an unknown enemy. The war was very destructive and used weapons so powerful that their owners began to fear the consequences of using them, such as the Behemoths, giant warforged that tower over the normal races.

**The Act of Obedience**; Due to their fear of the Behemoth-sized warforged, the First Empire decided to dispose of them. Taking advantage of their unquestioning loyalty, the First Empire ordered the Behemoths down into a massive pit, and then betrayed their servants by encasing the pit in solid metal. (Possibly included the ordering of suicide among normal-sized warforged, as there are many cases of warforged bodies found within the pits.)

**The Shattering**; A time of many calamities, from dangerous celestial activity, to natural disasters, to plagues, to a warforged rebellion (possibly in vengeance for The Act of Obedience). It's unclear exactly what happened, but it brought the great empire to its knees, and humanity to the brink of extinction. The most monumental calamity was "The Shattering" causing the moon to be fractured.

The moon was expected to be completely destroyed, however, it is speculated that the destruction was thwarted by a wizard-king who brought together the most powerful spellcasters at the time. The wizard-king, arch-druid, witch-queen, and sorcerer-king of the time used their magic to keep the moon's surface partially intact. The world's surface remain fractured, gravity was altered, and floating land masses became the norm. After everything stabilzed, the world started anew.

### Second Empire (1000+ Years Ago) 

**The Second Empire is Founded**; Many hundreds or thousands of years after The Shattering, in an effort to redeem themselves in the eyes of humanity for their actions of the past (though the humans had long since forgotten), Beetle and his Warforged followers founded an empire and attempted to rebuild civilization and study the remains of the Ancient Empire. These warforged paved the way for a new wave of technology. The most important invention was the airship. Airships became the staple method of transportation in the new world.

**The Second Empire starts to Crumble**; While initially founded with good intentions, in order to keep the peace the empire became more and more dictatorial. Child prisons, crackdowns on piracy and religious cults, and the killing of many of their own innocent citizens in the process greatly inflamed tensions amongst the populace. When a great famine hit, the Second Empire neared its breaking point.

**The Fall of the Second Empire**; It is unclear what actually caused the fall of the second empire. The strongest evidence would suggest betrayals from the inside, possibly combined with the rebellion of Dhondallâ€™s followers. But the empire collapsed. The prominent warforged retreated into the skies on their legendary airships, where they reside to this day, forever avoiding the past. The empire fell into ruins, though some settlements like the #### survived, and many likely became the current towns that exist today.

### Medial Period (200-1000 Years Ago)

**Appearance of the Thri-kreen (And other races)**; Though it is unclear when or how the Thri-kreen appeared, it is evident they were not around much, if at all, at the time of Beetle's empire. At least not in a form recognizable as a Thri-kreen. Whether they mutated from humans, or simply came from a land across the seas, they appeared and have been a resident of our lands ever since. This seems to be the case for other unique races.

**The Rise and Fall of Kral**; For as long as anyone can remember, the Goblinoid races were simple tribes living in the wilderness, divided and warring regularly. At one point a great Orc warrior named Kral unified the tribes into a powerful kingdom, taught his followers a code of honor and strength, and led them into a march of conquest. Eventually however, he was slain in battle against an enemy force that legends say outnumbered him hundredfold. After his death he attained near godlike levels of worship from his followers, who want nothing more than to die in a great battle like him. As such they have continued their raiding and warlike ways with their neighbors ever since.

### Recent History (0-200 Years Ago)

**The Current World;** The world is now currently in a golden age. Kingdoms, clans, and overall law and order is on the rise. Many promiment landmasses are settled and are interacting with one another through trade, war, and diplomacy. Many civilizations are making huge strives in magic, technology, and science. Most 


**The Expanding Core;** Current scholars have determined that the moon's core is currently growing in size and is magically forming landmasses causing the moon's surface area to rise. Landmasses rise, form, and take their spots near current masses in the span of months. The Expanding Core is currently fueling adventurers to discover, plunder, and settle the new lands. Wildlife also expands with new forms of life. Plants, animals, and creatures migrate throughout the new lands and evolve.

**Current Threats;** Not all kingdoms, humanoids, and creatures are lawful and good. The customarily evil races (Such as Drow, Orcs, Kobolds, and etc.) also create their own kingdoms, clans, and societys. These factions use their strength to wage war, raid fertile lands, and commit piracy through airships.  

**Whizzleroot Rises To Prominence;** Under the leadership of the wizard-king Windemuth, the city of Whizzleroot becomes prosperous.

## Thri-Kreen
### Thri-Kreen Traits
Your thri-kreen character has several inherent abilities that help it survive as a nomad in the harsh desert.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Thri-kreen grow quickly, moulting their childish carapace, and reach adulthood at age five. However, their average life expectancy is just 30 years.

***Alignment.*** Thri-kreen value freedom above power, and prefer tightly-knit groups to grand societies. They tend toward Chaotic Neutral.

***Size.*** All thri-kreen share the same light, slender build, though their expected height varies between 4 to 7 feet tall depending on the tribe. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

***Extra Arms.*** You have four arms, which can carry items normally and allow you to interact with one extra object for free on your turn (*Player's Handbook*, pg. 190). If you make an attack with a two-handed or loading weapon, you cannot benefit from a shield until the start of your next turn, even if another feature allows you to ignore these properties.

***Sleepless.*** You don't need to sleep, and can stay awake constantly without penalty. You receive the benefits of a long rest even if you spend eight hours engaged in light activity.

***Standing Leap.*** You can always jump as though you made a running start of at least 10 feet. When you take the Dash action, you double the distance you can jump that turn. Each foot you clear on a jump still costs you a foot of movement.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Thri-kreen. The thri-kreen language is incomprehensible to outsiders, a mixture of mandible clicks and antennae twitches that only a dedicated linguist could  mimic.

***Subrace.*** Thri-kreen have spread across the deserts of the world, developing into a diverse array of mantisfolk. Choose one of these subraces.

#### Bandit Kreen
The so-called mantis bandits stand under 5 feet tall, with a thick set of upper arms. Proud, belligerent, and very visually-focused, they link packs to form warbands which can prey upon outsiders or extort tolls from those crossing the desert, their allegiances marked by shifting carapace-banners.
___
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 1.
___
***Chameleonic Carapace.*** You can change your body's color to match your surroundings, allowing you to hide when lightly obscured by terrain. In addition, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) rolls if you have not moved since the start of your last turn.

<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>


#### Nomad Kreen
Towering over most civilized races at around 7 feet tall, with hides cast in shades of yellow and brown, the nomadic thri-kreen are wanderers and traders,  the shepherds of the sand. Ever-curious and blessed with nocturnal vision, they explore the desert and its borders for novelties at all hours.

___
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
___
***Darkvision.*** Your jewel-like faceted eyes grant improved vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
___
***Nomad.*** You gain proficiency in the Survival skill.

#### Praying Kreen
The emerald mystics of the praying thri-kreen are named as such for their practice of meditating near spots of spiritual significance. Their pilgrimages leave them  isolated, but the praying kreen are more prone to displays of emotion than their kin, easily caught up in the surrounding mood.
___
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
___
***Natural Psionic.*** You know the *mage hand* and *message* cantrips, and cast them with no components. The spectral hand you create with *mage hand* is invisible.
